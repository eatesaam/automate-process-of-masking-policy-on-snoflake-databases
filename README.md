## Snowflake Dynamic Data Masking Script

**Description:**

This Python script automates the creation and application of dynamic data masking policies in a Snowflake account. It helps protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data by masking it with a defined pattern (e.g., '########') for specific roles, while leaving data intact for authorized users.

**Features:**

- Connects to a Snowflake account using credentials stored in environment variables (for security).
- Retrieves a list of databases in the account. (Optional: Modify to filter specific databases)
- Identifies tables containing columns with potential PII data based on predefined names. (Consider expanding the list for your specific needs)
- Creates dynamic data masking policies for each identified PII column, applying masking only for unauthorized roles.
- Applies the masking policies to the corresponding columns in the tables.

**Installation:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python and the `snowflake-connector-python` library installed:

   ```bash
   pip install snowflake-connector-python
   ```

2. **Configuration:**

   - Replace placeholders in the script with your actual Snowflake credentials:

     ```python
     ACCOUNT = ''
     USER = ''
     PASSWORD = ''
     ```

   - Optionally, modify the `get_databases` function to filter specific databases if needed.
   - Consider extending the list of PII column names in the `get_pii_columns` function for your specific data.

**Usage:**

1. Save the script as `snowflake_data_masking.py`.
2. Set your Snowflake credentials as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account
   export SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
   export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python snowflake_data_masking.py
   ```

**Disclaimer:**

- This script is provided as-is for educational purposes. Test thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying.
- Consider security best practices for storing credentials (e.g., using environment variables or a secure configuration management system).
- The predefined list of PII column names might not be exhaustive. Adapt it to your specific data and regulatory requirements.

**Additional Notes:**

- The script currently logs output to the console. You can modify it to write to a log file or integrate with a logging framework for better tracking.
- Error handling can be improved to catch potential issues during connection, querying, or policy creation/application.
- Consider unit testing the script's functionalities to ensure its correctness and reliability.
